  <h1>To Ayesha, a blessing from Allah 💫</h1>

  <p>Alhamdulillah, for the beautiful gift that is you. In a world full of distractions, Allah has guided my heart to someone whose character shines with sincerity, compassion, and faith. You remind me daily of the Prophet ﷺ’s words: <strong>“The best among you are those who are best to their wives.”</strong> And though we are not yet married, I strive to treat you with the honor and kindness that Islam teaches.</p>

  <p>Your presence brings tranquility to my soul, just as Allah describes in the Qur’an:</p>

  <div class="quran">
    “And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them, and He placed between you affection and mercy.” <br><em>(Surah Ar-Rum 30:21)</em>
  </div>

  <p>You are a reflection of that mercy and affection. Your patience, your modesty, your strength in faith—all of it inspires me to be a better man, not just for you, but for the sake of Allah.</p>

  <p>May Allah bless you, protect your heart, and grant us both the ability to walk this path with taqwa, love, and purpose. I pray that our bond grows in righteousness and that one day, insha’Allah, we are united in a way that pleases our Creator.</p>
